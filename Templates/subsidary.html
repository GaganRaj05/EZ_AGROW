                technologies and manufacturing processes so as to reduce cost of production and the 
                emissions of GHGs. Activities under the scheme are: I. Capacity Building of MSME 
                Clusters for Energy Efficiency/Clean Development Interventions and other 
                technologies mandated as per the global standards. ii. Implementation of Energy 
                Efficient Technologies (EET) in MSME units. iii. Setting up of Carbon Credit Aggregation
